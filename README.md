# Multimodal Cancer Outcome Prediction - Deployment on AWS EC2

This guide outlines the steps to deploy the Multimodal Cancer Outcome Prediction web application on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance running Ubuntu.

## Prerequisites

* An active AWS account.
* Basic familiarity with the AWS Management Console.
* An SSH client (e.g., PuTTY on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
* Your project repository pushed to GitHub or a similar version control system.
* A security group configured to allow inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and port 22 (SSH) from your IP address or a wider range if necessary.

## Steps for Deployment

1.  **Launch an EC2 Instance:**
    * Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    * Navigate to the EC2 service.
    * Click on "Launch instance".
    * Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). For this guide, we'll assume **Ubuntu Server [Latest Version]**. Select an appropriate architecture (usually x86\_64).
    * Choose an Instance Type. A `t2.medium` or `t3.medium` instance should be sufficient for moderate traffic. Consider larger instances based on expected load.
    * **Configure Instance Details:** You can usually leave these as default for a basic deployment. Ensure the instance has an IAM role if it needs to interact with other AWS services securely.
    * **Configure Security Group:**
        * Either select an existing security group or create a new one.
        * **Crucially, ensure the security group allows inbound traffic on the following ports:**
            * **SSH (TCP port 22):** Limit the source to your IP address for security.
            * **HTTP (TCP port 80):** Allow from `0.0.0.0/0` to make the web application publicly accessible.
        * You might also want to open HTTPS (TCP port 443) later if you decide to implement SSL.
    * **Configure Storage:** Choose an appropriate size for your root volume (e.g., 30 GB).
    * **Add Tags (Optional):** Add tags for easier identification and management.
    * **Review and Launch:** Review your instance configuration and click "Launch". You will be prompted to select or create a key pair. **Download the private key file (`.pem` file) and store it securely.** You will need this to SSH into your instance.

2.  **Connect to Your EC2 Instance via SSH:**
    * Open your SSH client.
    * Use the following command (replace placeholders with your actual values):
        ```bash
        ssh -i /path/to/your/private_key.pem ubuntu@your_ec2_public_ip_or_dns
        ```
        * `/path/to/your/private_key.pem`: The path to the `.pem` file you downloaded.
        * `your_ec2_public_ip_or_dns`: The public IP address or public DNS name of your EC2 instance (you can find this in the AWS Management Console).

3.  **Install Necessary Software:**
    * Once connected, update the package lists:
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        ```
    * Install Python 3, pip, and other essential tools:
        ```bash
        sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv git
        ```

4.  **Clone Your Repository:**
    * Navigate to a suitable directory (e.g., your home directory):
        ```bash
        cd ~
        ```
    * Clone your project repository from GitHub:
        ```bash
        git clone <your_repository_url>
        cd <your_repository_name>
        ```

5.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:**
    * Create a virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        ```
    * Activate the virtual environment:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * Install the required Python packages from your `requirements.txt` file:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        *(Ensure your `requirements.txt` in the repository is up-to-date with all dependencies: Flask, pandas, torch, scikit-learn, joblib, etc.)*

6.  **Download Trained Model and Preprocessing Artifacts:**
    * If you haven't already, ensure the `model/model.pth` file and the contents of the `inference_files/` directory are present in the correct locations on your EC2 instance (either by including them in your repository or by transferring them separately using `scp`).

7.  **Run the Flask Application:**
    * Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`:
        ```bash
        cd ~/your_repository_name
        ```
    * Run the Flask application. For deployment, it's recommended to use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn instead of the built-in Flask development server. Install Gunicorn:
        ```bash
        pip install gunicorn
        ```
    * Run the application using Gunicorn, binding it to port 80:
        ```bash
        gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:80 app:app
        ```
        * `app`: The name of your Flask application instance in `app.py` (usually `app = Flask(__name__)`).

8.  **Access Your Application:**
    * Open your web browser and go to the **Public IP address** or the **Public DNS name** of your EC2 instance. You should see your "Multimodal Prediction Service" web interface.

## Managing the Application (Production Considerations)

* **Screen or Systemd:** To keep your application running even after you close your SSH session, use tools like `screen` or `systemd`.
    * **Screen:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt install screen
        screen -S myapp
        # Run your gunicorn command here
        # Press Ctrl+A then Ctrl+D to detach from the screen session
        screen -r myapp # To re-attach
        ```
    * **Systemd:** Create a service unit file (e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/myapp.service`):
        ```ini
        [Unit]
        Description=Multimodal Prediction Application
        After=network.target

        [Service]
        User=ubuntu
        WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/your_repository_name
        ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/your_repository_name/venv/bin/gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:80 app:app
        Restart=on-failure

        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target
        ```
        Then enable and start the service:
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        sudo systemctl enable myapp.service
        sudo systemctl start myapp.service
        sudo systemctl status myapp.service
        ```
* **Logging:** Configure proper logging for your Flask application and Gunicorn to monitor its health and troubleshoot issues.
* **Security:**
    * Consider implementing HTTPS using Let's Encrypt.
    * Regularly update your system packages.
    * Review and restrict security group rules.
    * Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
* **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) to track your instance's resource utilization and application performance.
* **Scalability:** For higher traffic, consider using load balancers and auto-scaling groups.

## Accessing the Web Interface

Once Gunicorn is running (either directly or through `screen`/`systemd`), you should be able to access your web application by navigating to the **Public IP address** or **Public DNS name** of your EC2 instance in your web browser.

This guide provides the fundamental steps for deploying your application on an EC2 instance. Depending on your specific needs and scale, you might need to explore more advanced deployment strategies and AWS services.
